Design and Architecture

Quackstagram adheres to core software design principles and patterns to ensure a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application. Here's a glimpse into the architectural decisions:

Design Patterns and Principles
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): We've minimized repetition across the codebase to enhance maintainability and scalability.
SOLID Principles: Each class is designed with a single responsibility, open for extension but closed for modification, and dependency inversion among others to ensure a decoupled and easily adaptable architecture.
GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns): Used to ensure a proper responsibility assignment, enhancing readability and the overall quality of the code.
Best Practices
Method and Class Design: Each method performs a single functionality, and classes are focused on a single concept, ensuring clarity and ease of debugging.
Separation of Concerns: UI and business logic, including credential handling, are kept separate to enhance security and make the codebase more organized.
