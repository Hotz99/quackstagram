1) create repositories for each entity model: entity models are programming types modelling database entities (or tables)

2) replaced data fetching from txt files with fetching from repositories

3) we lazy load posts when fetching users: query post ids and later query the actual posts, if needed

4) usernames are unique

TODO:
handle db connection failure
make sure user follows updates once follows tables is changed (trigger is built already)
